git remote add origin <-link->
git remote -v (to verify remote)

git branch (to check branch)

git branch -M main (to rename branch)

git push origin main


git checkout < branch name >  (to navigate)

git checkout -b <new branch name> (to create a new branch)

to delete branch - git checkout -d branch name


MErging Code

git diff <branch name>  (to compare commits, branch, files & more)

git merge <branch name>  (to merge 2 branches)
   OR 
   Create a PR


   PULL Request - 
   It lets you tell others about 
   chnages you've pushed to a 
   branch in a repositry on Github


   git pull origin main
   used to fetch and download content from
   a remote repo and immediately update
   the local repo to match that content.



   //Merge Conflicts
   
   An event that takes palce whn Git is unable 
   to automatically resolve differences uin code b/w
   two commits



   fixing Mistakes

Case1- staged changes
    git reset <file-name>
    git reset

Case2- commited chnages (for one commit)
    git reset HEAD-1

CAse3-  commited changes (for many commits)
    git reset <commit hash>
    git reset --hard <commit hash>


    git log - commit information
